# PRIME DIRECTIVE

Make sure the project is back on the `main` branch, that the branch is clean, that the previous branch has been pushed and merged. Once you confirm all of that, also clean up the local previous non-main branch by deleting it locally. The repository should now be current and ready for new updates.
